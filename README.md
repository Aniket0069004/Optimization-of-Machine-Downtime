# Optimization-of-Machine-Downtime
**Client:** One of the leading vehicle fuel pump manufacturers  

---

## Project Statement
Unplanned machine downtime in the manufacturing units is causing significant production losses. Manual monitoring and maintenance are not sufficient to predict or prevent these downtimes. Implementing data analysis can help detect patterns, predict failures, and optimize maintenance schedules.

---

## Business Objective
- Minimize unplanned machine downtime.

---

## Business Constraints
- Minimize maintenance costs while ensuring efficiency.

---

## Success Criteria

**Business Success Criteria:**  
- Reduce unplanned machine downtime by at least 10%.

**Economic Success Criteria:**  
- Achieve cost savings through optimized maintenance and reduced production losses.

**Data Science Success Criteria:**  
- Identify key factors causing downtime and provide actionable insights using data analysis.

## Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing **machine downtime in fuel pump manufacturing**. The main steps include:

1. **Data Collection:** Gathered machine performance and downtime logs.  
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, removed outliers, and formatted data for analysis.  
3. **Data Analysis:** Used Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to identify patterns and factors contributing to unplanned downtime.  
4. **Insights & Reporting:** Generated reports and dashboards to help management schedule predictive maintenance and reduce downtime.
